# Project purpose

BRIGHT COOKIE is a creative learning development and technology company, which specializes in innovative and customised eLearning solutions for educational and training purposes.

Bright Cookie develops new educational website applications, which are based on emerging social trends. The Company intends to create an image recognition app with the ability to recognize object and server relevant learning content based on the recognized object.

The project requires a team of information systems professionals to offer technical and development assistance to the client in its creation of an image recognition app.

# Project Scope

This project combines both conceptual/product design and practical development.

Evaluate and demonstrate the possibilities of linking image/video recognition software like OpenCV with the Experience Api. Retrieve information from images (OCR, Face recognition, geometric models) and store them as statements. Think about business models (Forensic, Lost property etc..) and showcase some them in a proof of concept.

A typical application may consist of 4 components

1. A client app wich takes/scans and uploads images (HTML5)
2. A server running OpenCv with a webservice to retrieve images and log statements to the xAPI LRS
3. An xAPI LRS instance (lxHive) as an event/data store
4. A reporting interface for for lxHive which complies and displays meaningful reports for humans
